                            <p> Risk aversion is a fundamental element in labor market decisions, which inherently involve risks. This paper examines how risk aversion influences occupational choices and earnings inequality, using data from the NLSY97. Descriptive findings indicate that more risk-averse workers tend to have lower earnings, with the earnings gap widening as their careers advance. Moreover, the evidence shows that risk-averse individuals are more likely to choose occupations with higher earnings stability but limited opportunities for earnings growth. To identify the causal effect of risk aversion on earnings and its underlying mechanisms, I develop a structural model of occupational choice that incorporates human capital accumulation and heterogeneity in risk aversion. The model is estimated using the EM algorithm with the Conditional Choice Probability estimator to accommodate unobserved heterogeneity. The estimated model confirms the considerable difference in the distribution of shocks to productivity across occupations, indicating the incentive for risk-averse workers to choose higher stability than the others. The decomposition of the earnings gap between risk attitude groups suggests that around 95 percent of the gap is due to risk aversion in occupation choices. Moreover, differences in human capital accumulation across occupations explain more than half of the gap, emphasizing the role of dynamic components of risk aversion effects. Using the estimated model, I show that risk-averse workers choose more profitable occupations under social insurance program with earnings floor, and thus earnings are redistributed from risk-tolerant workers to risk averse-ones.

                                <p> In this paper we estimate major specific earnings profiles using matched American Community Survey (ACS) and Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) data. The advantage of the matched data relative to the ACS alone is that it provides a long panel of worker earnings, thus avoiding estimating life cycle profiles using cross- cohort variation. Once we allow the returns to major to vary by cohort, we find that engineering, computer science, and business majors experience faster earnings growth relative to humanities majors. For example, the gap in earnings between technical majors like engineering and computer science and humanities grows by 5-6% between ages 23 and 50. Our estimates also indicate that more recent graduates in these fields earn a larger premium relative to humanities than earlier cohorts.
