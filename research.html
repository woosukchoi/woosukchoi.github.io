                            <p> This paper examines the role of risk aversion in shaping occupational choices and earnings distribution. Using hypothetical lottery questions in the NLSY97, I measure individual risk aversion and document that more risk-averse workers earn significantly less, with the gap widening over their careers. I show risk-averse workers are more likely to select occupations with greater earnings stability but lower levels and slower growth of earnings. To identify the causal effect of risk aversion on earnings and to explore the underlying mechanisms, I develop a structural model of occupation choice that accounts for the heterogeneity in risk aversion and human capital accumulation. The model is estimated using the EM algorithm combined with the Conditional Choice Probability estimator, allowing for unobserved heterogeneity in skills and risk aversion. The estimated model reveals substantial differences in the distribution of productivity shocks across occupations. Decomposition analysis attributes approximately 77 percent of the earnings gap between risk attitude groups to occupational sorting driven by risk aversion, with over half explained by differences in human capital accumulation. Using counterfactual simulations, I explore the labor market implications of social insurance that provides earnings floor. The findings indicate that such policies induces risk-averse workers to select into relatively higher-return occupations, resulting in a redistribution of earnings from risk-tolerant to risk-averse workers.

                                <p> In this paper we estimate major specific earnings profiles using matched American Community Survey (ACS) and Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) data. The advantage of the matched data relative to the ACS alone is that it provides a long panel of worker earnings, thus avoiding estimating life cycle profiles using cross- cohort variation. Once we allow the returns to major to vary by cohort, we find that engineering, computer science, and business majors experience faster earnings growth relative to humanities majors. For example, the gap in earnings between technical majors like engineering and computer science and humanities grows by 5-6% between ages 23 and 50. Our estimates also indicate that more recent graduates in these fields earn a larger premium relative to humanities than earlier cohorts.
